- Top Story
- Featured Stories
- Opinion
- Debate
- More Stories
- Culture and Travel
- Latest News
- In The Magazine
- Editor's Pick
- Series of Slide Shows

>These sections are rearranged depending on the size of the screen

## To achive this, Bootstrap breakpoints and media queries have been used
