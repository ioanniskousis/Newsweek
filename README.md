# Newsweek
This project demonstrates the use of Twitter‚Äôs Bootstrap framework by building a mock-up of Newsweek site that actually uses it

> The structure of the index page (index.html) is based on the Newsweek.com main page
> The page shows a variety of sections of links to articles and shows them responding to small, medium and large screens
- Top Story
- Featured Stories
- Opinion
- Debate
- More Stories
- Culture and Travel
- Latest News
- In The Magazine
- Editor's Pick
- Series of Slide Shows

>These sections are rearranged depending on the size of the screen

## To achive this, Bootstrap breakpoints and media queries have been used
